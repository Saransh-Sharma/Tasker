# fn-7.3 Keep completed tasks visible and undoable in Home quick views

## Description
Ensure completed tasks remain visible in Home quick views so users can immediately undo accidental completions.
The Focus Engine should keep completed tasks inline (with existing completed styling and reopen actions) across Today, Upcoming, Morning, and Evening views, while preserving Done timeline behavior.

## Acceptance
- [ ] Completed tasks do not disappear after marking complete in Today, Upcoming, Morning, or Evening quick views.
- [ ] Completed tasks remain undoable via checkbox and/or Reopen swipe action in those quick views.
- [ ] Completed tasks render with existing completed visuals (strikethrough + greyed styling).
- [ ] Within grouped sections, incomplete tasks appear before completed tasks.
- [ ] Done quick view timeline behavior is unchanged.
