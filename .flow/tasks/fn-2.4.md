# fn-2.4 Verification: unit/UI/visual regression coverage for redesign

## Description
Implement and run the validation suite for the redesign: unit tests for ranking/progress/metadata, UI tests for cockpit/focus/completed/swipe flows, and visual regression checks for compact density and readability. This task closes functional and UX regression risk before rollout.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Add unit tests for `HomeViewModel` focus ranking determinism across mixed overdue/due/priority/time datasets.
- [ ] Add unit tests for `progressState` updates on complete/reopen transitions.
- [ ] Add unit tests for compact row metadata formatting outputs.
- [ ] Add/update UI tests validating cockpit XP text updates, focus strip visibility/order, completed collapse/expand, and swipe behaviors.
- [ ] Add visual/snapshot regression checks for compact row height, completed contrast readability, and long-text clipping safety.
- [ ] Run project test/build commands and record evidence in flow task done summaries.
