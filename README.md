## Project Architecture

### Overview
Tasker follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture pattern with additional manager classes for business logic separation. The app is built using:

- **Core Data** with **CloudKit** integration for data persistence and synchronization
- **Material Design Components** and **FluentUI** for modern UI components
- **DGCharts framework** for advanced data visualization
- **Firebase** for analytics, crashlytics, and performance monitoring
- **Singleton pattern** for data managers to ensure consistent state management

### In-Depth Architecture Analysis

**Manager Class Interactions:**
`TaskManager` and `ProjectManager` serve as central hubs for managing `NTask` and `Projects` data, respectively. ViewControllers interact with these managers to fetch, create, or update data. For instance, `HomeViewController` calls methods like `TaskManager.sharedInstance.getMorningTasksForToday()` to populate its table view. Similarly, when a user creates a task, ViewControllers invoke manager methods such as `TaskManager.sharedInstance.createTask(...)` to persist the new data.

**ViewController Responsibilities:**
ViewControllers, exemplified by `HomeViewController`, currently handle a broad spectrum of responsibilities. These include setting up the user interface (often involving complex custom views like calendars and charts), managing user interactions, initiating data fetching operations by calling manager classes, and directly updating the UI in response to new data. Additionally, some business logic, such as calculating scores for display, is triggered from within `HomeViewController`.

**Custom UI Components:**
The `To Do List/View/` directory houses a variety of custom UI components, including `HomeBackdropView`, `HomeForedropView`, and `HomeBottomBarView`. These components are crucial for creating the app's distinctive layered user interface and contribute significantly to the overall user experience. They are designed to work seamlessly with UIKit, Material Components, and FluentUI to deliver a polished and engaging visual presentation.

### Architecture Layers

## Deep Analysis: TaskManager Architecture & Evolution

### TaskManager: The Legacy Foundation

`TaskManager` serves as the central hub for all task-related operations in the Tasker application. As a singleton class (`TaskManager.sharedInstance`), it provides a unified interface for task management across the entire application.

#### Core Responsibilities

**1. Core Data Management**
- Manages the Core Data `NSManagedObjectContext` for database operations
- Handles CRUD operations for `NTask` entities
- Provides context saving and error handling

**2. Task Type Management**
- Defines `TaskType` enum: `.morning`, `.evening`, `.upcoming`
- Defines `TaskPriority` enum: `.low`, `.medium`, `.high`
- Manages task categorization and filtering

**3. Task Lifecycle Operations**
```swift
// Core CRUD Operations
func addNewMorningTaskWithName(name: String, project: String)
func addNewEveningTaskWithName(name: String, project: String)
func toggleTaskComplete(task: NTask)
func removeTaskAtIndex(index: Int)
func reschedule(task: NTask, to date: Date)
```

**4. Advanced Query Interface**
- Date-based filtering (today, overdue, specific dates)
- Project-based filtering
- Completion status filtering
- Complex predicate-based queries using `NSPredicate`

#### Key Methods Analysis

**Task Retrieval Methods:**
- `getTasksForInboxForDate_All(date:)` - Inbox tasks for specific date
- `getTasksForProjectByName(projectName:)` - All tasks for a project
- `getTasksForAllCustomProjectsByNameForDate_Open(date:)` - Open custom project tasks
- `getTasksDueToday()` - Tasks due today
- `getTasksCompletedToday()` - Completed tasks for today
- `getOverdueTasks()` - Overdue incomplete tasks

**Data Integrity Methods:**
- `fixMissingTasksDataWithDefaults()` - Ensures data consistency
- `saveContext()` - Persists changes to Core Data
- `fetchTasks(predicate:sortDescriptors:)` - Generic fetch with filtering

### Architectural Evolution: From Monolith to Clean Architecture

#### Phase 1: Legacy Architecture (Pre-2025)
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  View Controllers│
│        ↓        │
│   TaskManager   │ ← Singleton, tightly coupled
│        ↓        │
│   Core Data     │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Challenges:**
- Tight coupling between UI and data layer
- Difficult to test due to singleton dependencies
- Mixed responsibilities (UI logic + data access)
- Hard to mock for unit testing

#### Phase 2: Repository Pattern Introduction (2025)
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  View Controllers│
│        ↓        │
│ TaskRepository  │ ← Protocol-based abstraction
│        ↓        │
│CoreDataTaskRepo │ ← Concrete implementation
│        ↓        │
│   Core Data     │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Improvements:**
- Protocol-based abstraction (`TaskRepository`)
- Dependency injection via `DependencyContainer`
- Background context operations for better performance
- `TaskData` struct for UI decoupling

#### Phase 3: Clean Architecture Target
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Presentation    │ ← SwiftUI/UIKit Views
│        ↓        │
│ Domain          │ ← Business Logic & Use Cases
│        ↓        │
│ Data            │ ← Repository Pattern
│        ↓        │
│ Infrastructure  │ ← Core Data, Network, etc.
└─────────────────┘
```

### Current State: Hybrid Architecture

The application currently operates in a **hybrid state** where:

**Legacy Components (TaskManager):**
- Still used extensively throughout the codebase
- Provides backward compatibility
- Handles complex business logic and data validation
- Used in: `HomeViewController`, `AddTaskViewController`, `ProjectManager`

**Modern Components (TaskRepository):**
- Used in newer view controllers like `TaskListViewController`
- Provides cleaner, testable architecture
- Better separation of concerns
- Async operations with completion handlers

### Clean Architecture Migration Roadmap

Based on the Clean Architecture principles (State Management, Use Cases, Presentation layers), this roadmap provides a structured approach to refactor Tasker into a maintainable, testable, and scalable architecture. Each phase ensures the app builds and runs successfully before proceeding to the next.

## Migration Overview

The migration follows a three-layer Clean Architecture approach:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Presentation Layer             │ ← UI, Controllers, ViewModels
│   (SwiftUI/UIKit Views)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Use Cases / Business Layer     │ ← Business Logic, Workflows
│   (Stateless Operations)            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      State Management Layer         │ ← Repositories, Data Sources
│   (Core Data, CloudKit, Cache)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core Principles:**
- ✅ Downward dependencies only (no upward communication)
- ✅ Communicate via interfaces (protocols)
- ✅ Pass domain objects between layers
- ✅ Test at boundaries
- ✅ Each phase produces a working, buildable app

- [ ] Copy interface definitions from Phase 1
- [ ] Set up DI container configuration
- [ ] Create first domain model and mapper
- [ ] Write first contract test

### Per-Phase Verification
After each phase, ensure:
- [ ] App builds without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No functionality regression
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged

### Migration Rules
1. **Never break the build** - Each commit should compile
2. **Incremental changes** - Small, reviewable PRs
3. **Test first** - Write tests before refactoring
4. **Document decisions** - Update architecture docs
5. **Backwards compatible** - Maintain existing functionality


---

#### Completed Migrations ✅
1. **TaskListViewController** - Fully migrated to repository pattern with NSFetchedResultsController
2. **DependencyContainer** - Centralized dependency management with injection system
3. **TaskData struct** - UI/Core Data decoupling layer
4. **Background contexts** - Improved performance for data operations
5. **CoreDataTaskRepository** - Complete repository implementation with async operations
6. **TaskScoringService** - Dedicated service for scoring logic
7. **DateUtils & LoggingService** - Utility layer implementations

#### Pending Migrations 🔄
1. **HomeViewController** - Still heavily dependent on TaskManager singleton
2. **AddTaskViewController** - Mixed usage of both patterns
3. **Project Management** - ProjectManager still calls TaskManager directly
4. **Analytics & Charts** - Direct TaskManager dependencies remain

### Technical Debt & Refactoring Opportunities

#### 1. Singleton Dependencies
```swift
// Current (Legacy)
TaskManager.sharedInstance.toggleTaskComplete(task: task)

// Target (Dependency Injection)
class HomeViewController: TaskRepositoryDependent {
    var taskRepository: TaskRepository!
    // Use injected dependency
}
```

#### 2. Mixed Responsibilities
- TaskManager handles both data access AND business logic
- Should be split into separate concerns
- Business logic should move to Use Cases/Services

#### 3. Error Handling
```swift
// Legacy: Silent failures
TaskManager.sharedInstance.saveContext()

// Modern: Explicit error handling
taskRepository.addTask(data: taskData) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success: // Handle success
    case .failure(let error): // Handle error
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

#### TaskManager Optimizations
- Uses `NSFetchedResultsController` for efficient UI updates
- Implements lazy loading with computed properties
- Caches frequently accessed data

#### Repository Pattern Benefits
- Background context operations prevent UI blocking
- Better memory management with proper context handling
- Async operations with completion handlers

### Testing Strategy

#### Current Challenges
- Singleton pattern makes unit testing difficult
- Tight coupling to Core Data
- Hard to mock dependencies

#### Repository Pattern Advantages
```swift
// Mockable for testing
protocol TaskRepository {
    func fetchTasks(completion: @escaping ([TaskData]) -> Void)
}

class MockTaskRepository: TaskRepository {
    func fetchTasks(completion: @escaping ([TaskData]) -> Void) {
        completion([/* mock data */])
    }
}
```

### Refactored Architecture (2025 Update)

Tasker has undergone a comprehensive refactoring to improve maintainability, testability, and performance. This refactoring has been implemented in six phases:

#### Phase 1: Predicate-Driven Fetching & Removal of Stored Arrays ✅

- `DateUtils` - Comprehensive date and time utilities
- `LoggingService` - Structured logging system with multiple levels
- `TaskScoringService` - Dedicated service for task scoring and analytics
- `ToDoTimeUtils` - Legacy time utilities (being migrated to DateUtils)

## Core Entities & Data Model

### NTask Entity
The primary task entity (`NTask`) stores all information related to a task. Its properties, defined in `NTask+CoreDataProperties.swift`, include:

```swift
@NSManaged public var name: String                    // Task title
@NSManaged public var isComplete: Bool                // Completion status
@NSManaged public var dueDate: NSDate?               // Due date for scheduling
@NSManaged public var taskDetails: String?           // Additional task description
@NSManaged public var taskPriority: Int32            // Priority level (stored as enum raw value)
@NSManaged public var taskType: Int32                // Category (stored as enum raw value)
@NSManaged public var project: String?               // Associated project name
@NSManaged public var alertReminderTime: NSDate?     // Notification scheduling
@NSManaged public var dateAdded: NSDate?             // Creation timestamp
@NSManaged public var isEveningTask: Bool            // Evening task flag
@NSManaged public var dateCompleted: NSDate?         // Completion timestamp
```

**Task Priority System (Type-Safe Enum):**
```swift
enum TaskPriority: Int32, CaseIterable {
    case highest = 1    // P0: 7 points
    case high = 2       // P1: 4 points
    case medium = 3     // P2: 3 points (default)
    case low = 4        // P3: 2 points
}
```

**Task Type Categories (Type-Safe Enum):**
```swift
enum TaskType: Int32, CaseIterable {
    case morning = 1    // Morning tasks
    case evening = 2    // Evening tasks
    case upcoming = 3   // Future-dated tasks
    case inbox = 4      // Uncategorized tasks
}
```

### NTask Extensions & Type-Safe Accessors

The `NTask+Extensions.swift` file provides type-safe computed properties and business logic:

```swift
// Type-safe enum accessors
extension NTask {
    var taskType: TaskType {
        get { TaskType(rawValue: self.taskType) ?? .morning }
        set { self.taskType = newValue.rawValue }
    }
    
    var taskPriority: TaskPriority {
        get { TaskPriority(rawValue: self.taskPriority) ?? .medium }
        set { self.taskPriority = newValue.rawValue }
    }
    
    // Computed properties for task categorization
    var isMorningTask: Bool {
        return taskType == .morning
    }
    
    var isUpcomingTask: Bool {
        return taskType == .upcoming
    }
    
    var isHighPriority: Bool {
        return taskPriority == .highest || taskPriority == .high
    }
    
    var isMediumPriority: Bool {
        return taskPriority == .medium
    }
    
    var isLowPriority: Bool {
        return taskPriority == .low
    }
    
    // Business logic for evening task management
    func updateEveningTaskStatus() {
        if taskType == .evening {
            isEveningTask = true
        } else {
            isEveningTask = false
        }
    }
}
```

### TaskData Presentation Model

The `TaskData.swift` struct serves as a clean presentation layer model:

```swift
struct TaskData {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let details: String?
    let type: TaskType
    let priority: TaskPriority
    let dueDate: Date?
    let project: String?
    let isComplete: Bool
    let dateAdded: Date?
    let dateCompleted: Date?
    
    // Initializer from Core Data managed object
    init(from managedObject: NTask) {
        self.id = managedObject.objectID.uriRepresentation().absoluteString
        self.name = managedObject.name ?? ""
        self.details = managedObject.taskDetails
        self.type = TaskType(rawValue: managedObject.taskType) ?? .morning
        self.priority = TaskPriority(rawValue: managedObject.taskPriority) ?? .medium
        self.dueDate = managedObject.dueDate as Date?
        self.project = managedObject.project
        self.isComplete = managedObject.isComplete
        self.dateAdded = managedObject.dateAdded as Date?
        self.dateCompleted = managedObject.dateCompleted as Date?
    }
    
    // Initializer for new tasks
    init(name: String, details: String?, type: TaskType, priority: TaskPriority, 
         dueDate: Date?, project: String?) {
        self.id = UUID()
        self.name = name
        self.details = details
        self.type = type
        self.priority = priority
        self.dueDate = dueDate
        self.project = project
        self.isComplete = false
        self.dateAdded = Date()
        self.dateCompleted = nil
    }
}
```

### ToDoListViewType Enum

The view type system provides flexible list filtering:

```swift
enum ToDoListViewType {
    case todayHomeView      // Today's tasks
    case customDateView     // Tasks for specific date
    case projectView        // Tasks filtered by project
    case upcomingView       // Future tasks
    case historyView        // Completed tasks
    case allProjectsGrouped // All tasks grouped by project
    case selectedProjectsGrouped // Selected projects only
}
```

### Core Data Repository Pattern

The repository pattern abstracts data access:

```swift
class CoreDataTaskRepository {
    private let context: NSManagedObjectContext
    
    init(context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
        self.context = context
    }
    
    func fetchTasks(for viewType: ToDoListViewType, date: Date? = nil, 
                   project: String? = nil) -> [TaskData] {
        let request: NSFetchRequest<NTask> = NTask.fetchRequest()
        
        switch viewType {
        case .todayHomeView:
            request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "dueDate >= %@ AND dueDate < %@", 
                                          Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date()) as NSDate,
                                          Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, 
                                          to: Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date()))! as NSDate)
        case .projectView:
            if let project = project {
                request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "project == %@", project)
            }
        case .upcomingView:
            request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "dueDate > %@", Date() as NSDate)
        case .historyView:
            request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "isComplete == YES")
        default:
            break
        }
        
        request.sortDescriptors = [
            NSSortDescriptor(key: "taskPriority", ascending: true),
            NSSortDescriptor(key: "dueDate", ascending: true)
        ]
        
        do {
            let managedTasks = try context.fetch(request)
            return managedTasks.map { TaskData(from: $0) }
        } catch {
            print("Error fetching tasks: \(error)")
            return []
        }
    }
    
    func save(task: TaskData) throws {
        let managedTask = NTask(context: context)
        managedTask.name = task.name
        managedTask.taskDetails = task.details
        managedTask.taskType = task.type.rawValue
        managedTask.taskPriority = task.priority.rawValue
        managedTask.dueDate = task.dueDate as NSDate?
        managedTask.project = task.project
        managedTask.isComplete = task.isComplete
        managedTask.dateAdded = task.dateAdded as NSDate?
        managedTask.dateCompleted = task.dateCompleted as NSDate?
        
        try context.save()
    }
}
```

### Task Scoring Service

The scoring system calculates points based on priority and completion:

```swift
class TaskScoringService {
    static func calculateScore(for task: TaskData) -> Int {
        guard task.isComplete else { return 0 }
        
        switch task.priority {
        case .highest: return 7  // P0 tasks
        case .high: return 4     // P1 tasks
        case .medium: return 3   // P2 tasks (default)
        case .low: return 2      // P3 tasks
        }
    }
    
    static func calculateDailyScore(tasks: [TaskData]) -> Int {
        return tasks.reduce(0) { total, task in
            total + calculateScore(for: task)
        }
    }
    
    static func calculateWeeklyScore(tasks: [TaskData]) -> Int {
        let calendar = Calendar.current
        let now = Date()
        let weekStart = calendar.dateInterval(of: .weekOfYear, for: now)?.start ?? now
        
        let weeklyTasks = tasks.filter { task in
            guard let completedDate = task.dateCompleted else { return false }
            return completedDate >= weekStart && completedDate <= now
        }
        
        return calculateDailyScore(tasks: weeklyTasks)
    }
}
```

### Core Data & Enum Integration

The refactored architecture properly handles the conversion between Core Data's `Int32` attributes and Swift enums:

**Converting from Enum to Int32 (when saving):**
```swift
// In CoreDataTaskRepository.swift
managed.taskType = data.type.rawValue     // Store enum's raw value
managed.taskPriority = data.priority.rawValue
```

**Converting from Int32 to Enum (when fetching):**
```swift
// In TaskData.swift initializer
self.type = TaskType(rawValue: managedObject.taskType) ?? .morning
self.priority = TaskPriority(rawValue: managedObject.taskPriority) ?? .medium
```

**Using Enum Values in Switch Statements:**
```swift
// In TaskCell.configure(with:) method
switch task.taskPriority {
case TaskPriority.high.rawValue:
    priorityIndicator.backgroundColor = .systemRed
// ...
}
```
- **Evening Tasks (2)**: Tasks scheduled for evening completion
- **Upcoming Tasks (3)**: Future-scheduled tasks
- **Inbox Tasks (4)**: Unscheduled/default category

### Projects Entity
Simple project organization structure:

```swift
@NSManaged public var projectName: String?           // Project identifier
@NSManaged public var projectDescription: String?     // Project description
```

**Default Project System:**
- "Inbox" serves as the default catch-all project
- Custom projects can be created for task organization
- Project-based task filtering and management

## Domain Logic & Business Rules

### Scoring System
The gamification core revolves around a sophisticated scoring algorithm:

```swift
func getTaskScore(task: NTask) -> Int {
    switch task.taskPriority {
    case 1: return 7  // P0 - Highest priority
    case 2: return 4  // P1 - High priority  
    case 3: return 3  // P2 - Medium priority
    case 4: return 2  // P3 - Low priority
    default: return 1 // Fallback
    }
}
```

### Task Management Rules
1. **Default Assignment**: New tasks default to P2 priority and morning type
2. **Project Association**: Tasks without explicit project assignment go to "Inbox"
3. **Completion Tracking**: `dateCompleted` timestamp enables historical analysis
4. **Evening Task Logic**: Special handling for evening-scheduled tasks

### Data Validation
- Project existence validation with automatic "Inbox" creation
- Task priority bounds checking (1-4 range)
- Date validation for scheduling and completion tracking

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Task Creation Flow
```
AddTaskViewController → TaskManager → Core Data → CloudKit
                    ↓
            UI Updates → HomeViewController
```

**Detailed Flow:**
1. User inputs task details in `AddTaskViewController`.
2. Task metadata (priority, project, type, dates) is collected.
3. `TaskManager.sharedInstance` is called to create a new `NTask` entity with the provided details.
4. The `TaskManager` saves the new task to the local Core Data store.
5. CloudKit automatically synchronizes the changes to other devices if connected.
6. The UI, typically in `HomeViewController` or the originating view, refreshes to display the newly added task.

### 2. Task Retrieval & Display Flow
```
HomeViewController → TaskManager → Core Data Fetch → UI Rendering
                 ↓
         Analytics Update → DGCharts Framework
```
**Detailed Flow:**
When `HomeViewController` needs to display tasks, it calls methods on `TaskManager` (e.g., `getMorningTasksForDate(date:)`). The `TaskManager` then constructs and executes an `NSFetchRequest` against the Core Data stack. The results (`[NTask]`) are returned to `HomeViewController`, which then processes this data to populate its UITableView. Similar flows occur for project filtering, where `ProjectManager` might be consulted first to get relevant projects before tasks are fetched.

**Filtering Logic:**
- **Date-based filtering**: Tasks for specific dates
- **Project-based filtering**: Tasks within specific projects
  - **All Projects View**: Group and display tasks by all available projects
  - **Multi-Project Selection**: Select multiple specific projects to filter tasks
  - **Single Project View**: Focus on tasks from one selected project
  - **Project Drawer Interface**: Access project filtering through the top drawer menu
- **Type-based filtering**: Morning, evening, upcoming, inbox categorization
- **Completion status filtering**: Active vs completed tasks

### 3. Analytics & Scoring Flow
```
Task Completion → Score Calculation → Chart Data Update → UI Refresh
              ↓
      Historical Data → Trend Analysis → Productivity Insights
```

### 4. Project Management Flow
```
ProjectManager → Projects Entity → Task Association → UI Organization
            ↓
    Default Project Validation → "Inbox" Creation if Missing
```

## Entity Attribute Reference & ER Diagram

### Entity Overview
| Entity | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `NTask` | Primary task record – one row per user task |
| `Projects` | Simple categorisation master list. Each `NTask` references a project via the `project` string column. |

### `NTask` – Attribute Table
| Attribute | Type | Optional | Default | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `name` | `String` | ❌ | — | Task title shown in lists & detail pages |
| `isComplete` | `Bool` | ❌ | `false` | Flag when a task has been marked done |
| `dueDate` | `Date` | ✅ | — | When the task is scheduled to be completed (nil → unscheduled) |
| `taskDetails` | `String` | ✅ | — | Rich description / notes |
| `taskPriority` | `Int32` (`TaskPriority`) | ❌ | `3` (`.medium`) | Enum-backed 1→4 => P0…P3 |
| `taskType` | `Int32` (`TaskType`) | ❌ | `1` (`.morning`) | Enum-backed 1→4 => Morning/Evening/Upcoming/Inbox |
| `project` | `String` | ✅ | “Inbox” | Foreign-key (string) to `Projects.projectName` |
| `alertReminderTime` | `Date` | ✅ | — | Local notification trigger time |
| `dateAdded` | `Date` | ✅ | *now()* | Creation timestamp (set automatically) |
| `isEveningTask` | `Bool` | ❌ | `false` | Redundant convenience flag – kept for legacy UI logic |
| `dateCompleted` | `Date` | ✅ | — | Set when `isComplete` toggles to true |

> **Delete Rule:** `NTask` objects persist even if their `project` string no longer matches an existing `Projects` row. A future migration intends to convert this string into a formal Core-Data relationship with *Nullify* delete rule.

### `Projects` – Attribute Table
| Attribute | Type | Optional | Default | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `projectName` | `String` | ✅ | — | Primary identifier (acts as natural key) |
| `projecDescription` | `String` | ✅ | — | User-facing description *(attribute typo preserved for Core Data compatibility)* |

> **Relationship:** `Projects 1 — * NTask` (logical). Currently enforced in UI/business-logic level, not Core Data. Deleting a project uses a manual merge routine (`mergeInboxDuplicates`) to re-assign tasks to *Inbox*.

### Mermaid ER Diagram
```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROJECTS ||--o{ NTASK : "contains"
    PROJECTS {
        string projectName PK
        string projecDescription
    }
    NTASK {
        string name
        bool   isComplete
        date   dueDate
        string taskDetails
        int    taskPriority
        int    taskType
        string project FK
        date   alertReminderTime
        date   dateAdded
        bool   isEveningTask
        date   dateCompleted
    }
```

### Computed Properties & Helpers (`NTask+Extensions`)
* `type` & `priority` – enum-safe wrappers around `taskType` / `taskPriority`.
* Convenience booleans: `isMorningTask`, `isUpcomingTask`, `isHighPriority` …
* `updateEveningTaskStatus(_:)` synchronises `isEveningTask` with `taskType`.

- `customDateView`: Tasks for user-selected dates
- `projectView`: Single project task filtering
- `upcomingView`: Future tasks with due date sorting
- `historyView`: Completed tasks with completion date grouping
- `allProjectsGrouped`: All tasks grouped by project
- `selectedProjectsGrouped`: Multiple selected projects view

### Project Filtering System
**Multi-level Project Organization**
- **Filter Drawer Interface**: Accessible via the top drawer menu in `HomeViewController`
- **Project Selection Mechanisms**:
  - **All Projects View**: Groups tasks by project, displaying each project as a separate section
  - **Multi-Project Selection**: Uses a collection view of project pills that allows selecting multiple projects simultaneously
  - **Single Project View**: Focuses the view on tasks from one specific project
- **User Interaction Flow**:
  1. **Accessing Filters**: Tap the filter icon in the top navigation bar to open the drawer
  2. **All Projects View**: Select "Show All Projects" to see tasks grouped by project
  3. **Multi-Project Selection**: 
     - Tap on project pills in the selection view to select multiple projects
     - Selected projects are highlighted visually
     - Tap "Apply Filters" to view tasks from only the selected projects
  4. **Single Project View**: Tap on a project pill in the main interface to focus on that project
  5. **Clearing Filters**: Tap the X button to clear project filters and return to the default view
- **Implementation Details**:
  - `HomeDrawerFilterView.swift`: Contains the drawer UI with project filtering options
  - `ProjectPillCell.swift`: Custom collection view cell for project selection
  - `selectedProjectNamesForFilter`: Array in `HomeViewController` that tracks selected projects
  - `prepareAndFetchTasksForProjectGroupedView()`: Method that fetches and organizes tasks by project
  - View type management through `ToDoListViewType` enum (.allProjectsGrouped, .selectedProjectsGrouped, .projectView)
- **Project Data Flow**:
  - `ProjectManager` maintains the source of truth for projects with the `@Published projects` property
  - `displayedProjects` computed property ensures "Inbox" is always first in the list
  - Project selection state is maintained in `HomeViewController`
  - Task filtering by project is handled by `TaskManager` methods

**Key Components:**
- Score counter with dynamic font sizing
- Tiny pie chart for completion ratio visualization
- Line chart for historical productivity trends
- Project filter bar with dynamic project loading
- Task list with priority-based visual indicators

### Task Creation (`AddTaskViewController`)

    let dataSet = LineChartDataSet(entries: generateLineChartData(), label: "Score")
    // Styling and animation configuration
    lineChartView.data = LineChartData(dataSet: dataSet)
}

// Pie Chart Score Integration
func setTinyPieChartScoreText() -> NSAttributedString {
    let score = calculateTodaysScore()
    // Dynamic font sizing based on score
    // Color and styling application
}
```

### Project Management System
**Hierarchical Task Organization**

**Project Lifecycle:**
1. **Creation**: Dynamic project creation through UI
2. **Assignment**: Task-to-project association
3. **Filtering**: Project-based task views
4. **Management**: Project editing and deletion

**Default Project Handling:**
```swift
func fixMissingProjectsDataWithDefaults() {
    // Ensures "Inbox" project always exists
    // Handles missing project scenarios
    // Maintains data integrity
}
```

### CloudKit Integration
**Fully Implemented Multi-Device Synchronization**

**Configuration:**
```swift
lazy var persistentContainer: NSPersistentCloudKitContainer = {
    let container = NSPersistentCloudKitContainer(name: "TaskModel")
    
    guard let description = container.persistentStoreDescriptions.first else {
        fatalError("Failed to retrieve a persistent store description.")
    }
    
    // CloudKit container setup
    description.cloudKitContainerOptions = NSPersistentCloudKitContainerOptions(
        containerIdentifier: "iCloud.TaskerCloudKit"
    )
    
    // Enable history tracking and remote notifications
    description.setOption(true as NSNumber, forKey: NSPersistentHistoryTrackingKey)
    description.setOption(true as NSNumber, forKey: NSPersistentStoreRemoteChangeNotificationPostOptionKey)
    
    return container
}()
```

**Sync Features:**
- **Container Identifier**: `iCloud.TaskerCloudKit` for dedicated CloudKit container

## Path to Clean Architecture

### Current State and Future Direction
Tasker is currently in a transitional phase, evolving from a traditional MVC architecture to Clean Architecture principles. This migration is being implemented incrementally to maintain stability while improving code organization and testability.

### Introduction to Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates concerns into distinct, concentric layers. It emphasizes independence from frameworks, UI, database, and external agencies. The core idea is that business logic and application logic should stand at the center, with dependencies pointing inwards.

**Core Principles:**
-   **Entities:** Represent enterprise-wide business rules and data structures. They are the most general and high-level rules and are typically plain Swift objects or structs, having no knowledge of other layers.
-   **Use Cases (Interactors):** Contain application-specific business rules. They orchestrate the flow of data to and from Entities and direct those Entities to use their critical business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.
-   **Interface Adapters:** This layer converts data from the format most convenient for Use Cases and Entities to the format most convenient for external agencies like the UI or database. This includes Presenters, ViewModels, and Controllers (in an MVC context adapted for Clean Architecture).
-   **Frameworks & Drivers:** The outermost layer consists of frameworks and tools such as the Database (e.g., Core Data), the UI (e.g., UIKit), and external interfaces. This layer is where all the details go.

**Benefits:**
Adopting Clean Architecture can lead to systems that are:
-   **Independent of Frameworks:** The core business logic is not tied to specific frameworks.
-   **Testable:** Business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web Server, or any other external element.
-   **Independent of UI:** The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the system.
-   **Independent of Database:** You can swap out Oracle or SQL Server for Mongo, BigTable, or CouchDB. Your business rules are not bound to the database.
-   **Maintainable & Scalable:** Changes in one area are less likely to impact others, making the system easier to maintain and scale.

### Proposed Layers for Tasker (Clean Architecture)

Here's a potential structure for Tasker if it were to adopt Clean Architecture:

#### 1. Domain Layer
This is the core of the application, containing the enterprise-wide and application-specific business rules.
-   **Entities:**
    *   Plain Swift structs/classes representing `CleanTask` and `CleanProject`. These would be independent of Core Data.
        *   Example: `struct CleanTask { let id: UUID; var name: String; var priority: Int; var isCompleted: Bool; var dueDate: Date?; ... }`
        *   Example: `struct CleanProject { let id: UUID; var name: String; var description: String?; ... }`
    *   **Use Cases (Interactors):**
        *   Classes that encapsulate specific application actions and orchestrate data flow using Entities.
        *   Examples:
            *   `AddTaskUseCase(taskRepository: TaskRepositoryProtocol)`
            *   `CompleteTaskUseCase(taskRepository: TaskRepositoryProtocol, scoringService: ScoringServiceProtocol)`
            *   `GetTasksForDateUseCase(taskRepository: TaskRepositoryProtocol)`
            *   `CalculateDailyScoreUseCase(taskRepository: TaskRepositoryProtocol)` // Could also be part of a broader `ScoringService`
            *   `ManageProjectUseCase(projectRepository: ProjectRepositoryProtocol)` // For creating, updating, deleting projects
    *   **Repository Protocols:**
        *   Abstract interfaces defining data operations for entities. These protocols are owned by the Domain layer.
        *   Example: `protocol TaskRepositoryProtocol { func getAllTasks() async throws -> [CleanTask]; func getTask(byId id: UUID) async throws -> CleanTask?; func save(task: CleanTask) async throws; func delete(taskId: UUID) async throws; ... }`
        *   Example: `protocol ProjectRepositoryProtocol { func getAllProjects() async throws -> [CleanProject]; func save(project: CleanProject) async throws; ... }`

#### 2. Data Layer (Infrastructure)
This layer is responsible for data persistence and retrieval, implementing the repository protocols defined in the Domain layer.
-   **Repositories (Implementations):**
    *   `CoreDataTaskRepository(context: NSManagedObjectContext): TaskRepositoryProtocol`: This class would handle fetching `NTask` (Core Data managed objects) and mapping them to/from `CleanTask` domain entities. It would also manage saving `CleanTask` entities back to Core Data.
    *   `CoreDataProjectRepository(context: NSManagedObjectContext): ProjectRepositoryProtocol`: Similar responsibilities for `Projects` and `CleanProject` entities.
-   **Data Sources:**
    *   Direct interaction with Core Data (`NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`).
    *   CloudKit synchronization would continue to be managed by Core Data's `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`. The Data layer abstracts these details away from the Domain layer, meaning the Use Cases are unaware of Core Data or CloudKit.
-   **Mappers:**
    *   Utility functions or structs responsible for converting data between Core Data `NSManagedObject`s (e.g., `NTask`) and Domain `Entities` (e.g., `CleanTask`), and vice-versa.

#### 3. Presentation Layer (e.g., MVVM - Model-View-ViewModel)
This layer is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interactions.
-   **ViewModels:** (e.g., `HomeViewModel`, `AddTaskViewModel`, `ProjectListViewModel`)
    *   Each ViewModel would own and call relevant Use Cases to fetch or modify data.
    *   They transform data received from Use Cases into a format suitable for display (e.g., formatting dates, calculating progress percentages for UI elements).
    *   They expose data to the Views, often using reactive programming frameworks like Combine or RxSwift, or through simple observable properties with callbacks.
    *   Handle user input by invoking appropriate Use Cases.
-   **Views (ViewControllers & Custom Views):**
    *   Would become significantly thinner and more focused on UI responsibilities.
    *   Display data provided by their respective ViewModels.
    *   Forward user input and events to their ViewModels.
    *   Contain minimal to no business logic or direct data access. `HomeViewController`, for example, would delegate most of its current responsibilities to a `HomeViewModel`.

#### 4. Dependency Injection
-   A mechanism for constructing and providing dependencies throughout the application would be essential.
-   This could be achieved through:
    *   **Manual Dependency Injection:** Passing dependencies through initializers (constructor injection) or properties (property injection).
    *   **DI Containers:** Using libraries like Swinject or Factory to manage dependencies and their lifetimes.
-   Example: An `AddTaskViewModel` would receive an `AddTaskUseCase` instance, which in turn would have received a `CoreDataTaskRepository` (conforming to `TaskRepositoryProtocol`) instance.

### Key Refactoring Steps & Considerations

Migrating Tasker to a Clean Architecture would be a significant undertaking. Here are some key steps and considerations:

-   **Define Domain Entities:** Start by defining the pure Swift `CleanTask` and `CleanProject` structs/classes. These will form the core of your Domain layer.
-   **Define Repository Protocols:** Create the `TaskRepositoryProtocol` and `ProjectRepositoryProtocol` in the Domain layer.
-   **Implement Data Layer Repositories:**
    *   Create `CoreDataTaskRepository` and `CoreDataProjectRepository`.
    *   Implement data mapping functions to convert between Core Data `NTask`/`Projects` and `CleanTask`/`CleanProject` entities. This is a critical step for decoupling.
-   **Identify and Implement Use Cases:**
    *   Break down the existing functionality of `TaskManager` and `ProjectManager` into specific Use Cases.
    *   For example, `TaskManager.createTask(...)` could become `AddTaskUseCase.execute(taskData: ...)`.
    *   Scoring logic could be encapsulated within specific Use Cases or a dedicated `ScoringService` in the Domain layer.
-   **Refactor ViewControllers to use ViewModels (MVVM):**
    *   **`HomeViewController`:** This would be a major refactoring target.
        *   Introduce a `HomeViewModel`.
        *   The ViewModel would use Use Cases like `GetTasksForDateUseCase`, `GetProjectsUseCase`, and `CalculateDailyScoreUseCase`.
        *   The ViewController would observe the ViewModel for data to display (tasks, projects, score, chart data) and forward user actions (date changes, project selection) to the ViewModel.
    *   **`AddTaskViewController`:**
        *   Introduce an `AddTaskViewModel`.
        *   The ViewModel would use an `AddTaskUseCase` and potentially a `ManageProjectUseCase` (for fetching projects for selection or adding new ones).
-   **Decouple Managers:**
    *   The existing `TaskManager` and `ProjectManager` singletons mix data access, business rules, and sometimes state management. Their responsibilities need to be carefully disentangled:
        *   Data fetching and persistence logic moves to the Repository implementations in the Data Layer.
        *   Application-specific business rules (e.g., task validation, setting default values) move to Use Cases in the Domain Layer.
        *   Cross-cutting concerns like scoring, if complex, might become their own services within the Domain Layer, injected into Use Cases.
-   **Establish Dependency Injection:** Choose a DI strategy (manual or container) and apply it consistently to provide dependencies to Use Cases, Repositories, and ViewModels.
-   **Incremental Adoption:**
    *   It's highly recommended to adopt Clean Architecture incrementally rather than attempting a "big bang" refactor.
    *   Start with one feature or a small part of the application (e.g., the task creation flow or the display of morning tasks). Refactor this slice fully to the new architecture.
    *   This allows the team to learn and adapt, and provides value sooner.
-   **Testing:**
    *   A major driver for Clean Architecture is improved testability.
    *   **Domain Layer:** Entities and Use Cases can be unit tested in isolation. Use Cases can be tested by providing mock repository implementations.
    *   **Presentation Layer:** ViewModels can be unit tested by mocking the Use Cases they depend on.
    *   **Data Layer:** Repositories can be integration tested against a test Core Data stack.

By following these steps, Tasker can transition towards a more robust, maintainable, and testable architecture, better equipped for future growth and changes.
